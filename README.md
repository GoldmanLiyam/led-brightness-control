# LED brightness control
LED brightness control project using ESP32, CLI, potentiometer, PWM and RTOS.

## Features
- The system is controlled by RTOS.
- CLI controls the system status (ON/OFF).
- A timer controls the potentiometer readings.
- When the system is OFF, the LED will be turned off, and the timer stops.
- The readings from the potentiometer are mapped to the PWM's range (0-255).
- `cli_task` reads characters from the terminal with UART connection.
- The task accepts the following words: `off`, `Off`, `OFF`, `on`, `On`, `ON`.
- ON turns the system ON, OFF turns it OFF
- Any other word will trigger the `help` message, which clarifies
  the acceptable words.
- If the system is already ON/OFF when entering ON/OFF, the user will be notified.
- Max characters to enter - 63, after the 63rd character, the `cli_task` won't read any other character.
- As soon as the system is turned ON, a new reading will occur.
- In case the timer won't stop/start, an infinite loop will occur, which triggers the watchdog.
